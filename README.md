# Rezz Inspired NeoPixel Goggles

This is a small repo for the code to control the NeoPixel goggles as designed and worn by the awesome Canadian DJ [Rezz](http://officialrezz.com/).

The code is forked from the [Adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/rezz-inspired-neopixel-glasses/overview) to put these glasses together, with some minor changes.
